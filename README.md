# The Green Glass Door


## Premise 

This is a work-in-progress, web-based version of the Green Glass Door word riddle game. In this game, players have to guess what will be allowed through the green glass door. The trick is that **only words with double letters** are allowed through the door. For example, a kitten can pass through, but not a cat! You can learn more about the game [here](https://makeeasylife.com/what-is-the-green-glass-door-game/).

This game has a slight twist, in that you have to guess both what is allowed **and** not allowed (i.e. A ____  can pass, but not a _____). These two objects must be related in some way.

Big thanks to my students in the Girls Who Code SIP 2021 YumBrands classroom who introduced me to the game and inspired this project!

Another thank you to the Word Associations Network for providing the [Word Associations API](https://wordassociations.net/en/api) which is used to ensure that two objects are related.
